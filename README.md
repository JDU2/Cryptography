```python
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

from sage.all import *            # Use this import if the SageMath kernel is connected but the functionalities are still missing,
                                  # which can occur when the SageMath environment isn't properly initialized in your editor. 
                                  # (For example when working with jupyter notebook files within VS code)
